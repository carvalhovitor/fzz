My name is Fabrizia Posada. I’m a Bachelor of Design in Visual Programming (University of Brasilia, Brazil, 2016) and spent a year as a visiting student with a full scolarship at Parsons the New School for Design studying Communication Design.

I’m a maker. I have an urge to create things, specially bridges between my mind and the tangible world. The truth is, I have a thing for fantasy – doesn’t matter if on film, music, fashion, drawings or stories.
