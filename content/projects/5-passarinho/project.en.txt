_Passarinho_ (portuguese for little bird) is my undergraduate final project at University of Brasilia. It is a hybrid book based on the diary I kept between 2014 and 2016 so I could get a painful romantic relationship off my chest.

This is a book about memory, overcoming traumas and being a woman. I made an effort to communicate the feelings related to the phases of the story, which are _naivety, delusion and recovery_. There's also a specific media related to each phase: graphite, charcoal and red chalk, respectively. 

Illustrations and binding by me. Cover: grey linen manually screen printed by me.
